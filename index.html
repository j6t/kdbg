<h1>What is KDbg?</h1>
<p>KDbg is a graphical user interface to gdb, the GNU debugger. It
provides an intuitive interface for setting breakpoints, inspecting
variables, and stepping through code.
</p>
<p>KDbg requires KDE, the <a href="https://www.kde.org/">K Desktop
Environment</a>, but you can of course debug any program.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Inspection of variable values in a
	tree structure.
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I>Direct member</I>: For certain
	compound data types the most important member values are displayed
	next to the variable name, so that it is not necessary to expand the
	subtree of that variable in order to see the member value. For
	example, you don't need to go into a variable of type <span class="code">QString</span>
	if you want to see the string that the variable holds. (BTW, this is
	of course not hardcoded, but can be extended to new types.) KDbg can
	even <B>display Qt's QString values</B>, which are Unicode
	strings.
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Debugger at your finger tips: The
	basic debugger functions (step, next, run, finish, until,
	set/clear/enable/disable breakpoint) are bound to function keys <span class="code">F5</span>
	through <span class="code">F10</span>. Quick and easy.
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Of course, lots of other basic
	functions: View source code, search text, set program arguments and
	environment variables, display arbitrary expressions. Everything you
	need to debug a program!
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Debugging of core dumps, attaching
	to running processes is possible.
	</p>
	<li><p>Conditional breakpoints.
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are missing your favorite feature, see the <a href="#todo">todo-list</a>
whether I plan to add it.

<h1><a name="screenshots"></a>Screenshots</h1>
<h2>
The Main Window</h2>
<p><a href="kdbgtotal.png"><img src="kdbgtotalsm.png" alt="Main Window" width="208" height="180" border="0"/></a></p>
<p>The largest subwindow of the this screenshot is the source code.
Below the breakpoint list is visible.
The right column shows local variables, watched expressions, and the thread list
(from top to bottom).</p>
<p>To the left of the lines of source code the breakpoints
as well as the current point of execution are indicated. You see different
kinds of breakpoints: normal, disabled, temporary.</p>
<!--<p>Observe that the value of local variables can be inspected by pointing
the mouse over it; a "balloon" window appears and shows the value.</p> -->
<p>Clicking the small '+' signs in front of the source code lines will
display the machine code of the source line.</p>
<h2>
Variables and Watches</h2>
<p><a href="kdbglocalswatches.png"><img src="kdbglocalswatchessm.png" alt="Local variables and watched expressions" width="239" height="180" border="0"></img></a></p>
<p>This screen shot shows the local variables (of the current stack frame)
and arbitrary watch expressions side by side. Notice that the contents
of certain class members are displayed next to the variable, in this case
of type QString, although the variable is not expanded. Variables
that have changed since the last stop are indicated in red color.</p>

<h1><a name="download"></a>Download</h1>

<h2>Download Source Code</h2>
<p>Click here to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kdbg/files/Source%20Code/3.0.1/kdbg-3.0.1.tar.gz/download">download
the source code of <b>KDbg 3.0.1 - stable version</b></a> (from SourceForge.net).
</p>
<p>Consider joining the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/kdbg-l">KDbg
mailing list</a>.
</p>
<h2></a>Download via git</h2>
<p>KDbg development uses <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>.
To clone the git repository, do this, which you need to do only once:
</p>
<p class="cmd">git clone -b maint https://github.com/j6t/kdbg.git
</p>
<p>This will create a new directory <span class="code">kdbg</span> in your current directory
that contains the entire development history.
It will follow the stable branch of KDbg. If you already have done this in the past,
you can download the latest stable version with this command:
</p>
<p class="cmd">git pull origin maint
</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/j6t/kdbg/commits/maint">browse
the project history</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="compile"></a>Compile and Install</h2>
<p>Compiling is straight forward. Extract the source archive, then go
to the newly created directory and type:
</p>
<p class="cmd">cmake .<br/>
make<br/>sudo make install
</p>
<p>It is necessary that you have the KDE header files and libraries
installed. Some distributions do not automatically install the header
files. Please make sure that you installed them. It may also be
necessary to explicitly tell the location of KDE, e.g.:
</p>
<p class="cmd">cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .
</p>
<h2>Download Binaries</h2>
<p>Official Debian packages are available from
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/kdbg">https://packages.debian.org/kdbg</a>.
(Special thanks go to Ana Guerrero!)
</p>

<h1><a name="tips"></a>Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>

<p>For more tips see the <a href="manual/tips.html">online documentation</a>.</p>
<h2><a NAME="displayfmts"></a>Displaying variable values in different formats</h2>
<p>You can use gdb's format specifiers for displaying values in the expression
watch window in different formats. Just prefix the expression to display
by the format specifier. Example: <span class="code">/x foo->bar</span> will display the
value of <span class="code">foo->bar</span> in hexadecimal notation. Here is a list of gdb's
format specifiers:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td class="printfmt">/x</td>
<td>hexadecimal</td>

<td class="printfmt">/f</td>
<td>float</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="printfmt">/o</td>
<td>octal</td>

<td class="printfmt">/a</td>
<td>address</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="printfmt">/d</td>
<td>decimal</td>

<td class="printfmt">/i</td>
<td>instruction</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="printfmt">/u</td>
<td>unsigned decimal</td>

<td class="printfmt">/c</td>
<td>char</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="printfmt">/t</td>
<td>binary</td>

<td class="printfmt">/s</td>
<td>string</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="brkdyn"></a>Setting breakpoints in dynamically loaded modules</h2>
<p>The problem with dynamically loaded modules is that the debugger doesn't
know about the symbol information until the module has been loaded by <span class="code">dlopen()</span>.
This is extremely annoying if you want to debug constructors that are run
for static variables. The following trick works on systems that use glibc2.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Set a breakpoint that the program will hit before it loads the dynamic
module, e.g. in <span class="code">main</span>.</li>

<li>
Run the program until it stops at this breakpoint.</li>

<li>
Now you can set a breakpoint in the function <span class="code">_dl_debug_state</span>.
For this, open the breakpoint list (<i>View|Breakpoints</i>),
Type <span class="code">_dl_debug_state</span> in the edit box and click
<i>Add</i>.</li>

<li>
Continue the program until it stops at this breakpoint, which happens somewhere
inside <span class="code">dlopen()</span>! At this time, the symbols of the dynamic module
are already available, but the constructors are not yet executed.</li>

<li>
Now you can set a breakpoint in your constructor.</li>
</ol>
Be prepared
that the breakpoint at <span class="code">_dl_debug_state</span> will be hit several times
while <span class="code">dlopen()</span> does its work.
<p>Note that the <i>orphaned breakpoints</i> feature
does not really help. The reason is that orphaned breakpoints are not tried to be
installed until the program stops. For this reason it is still required to set
the breakpoint in <span class="code">_dl_debug_state</span>. However, the breakpoints are
preserved and can be set at any time, even before the program starts.</p>

<h2><a name="remote"></a>Remote debugging</h2>
<p>There's a hack so you can do remote debugging.&nbsp; Invoke kdbg like
this:
<p class="cmd">kdbg -r <span class="tip-tty">/dev/ttya</span> <span class="tip-prog">proggy</span></p>
Then KDbg issues the following gdb commands, in effect, it allows you to
debug a remote target:
<p class="cmd">target remote <span class="tip-tty">/dev/ttya</span><br/>
file <span class="tip-prog">proggy</span></p>
<p>
As you see, you could also do remote debugging through TCP/IP connection
like this:</p>
<p class="cmd">kdbg -r <span class="tip-tty">flaky:12345</span> <span class="tip-prog">proggy</span></p>
<p>assuming host <i>flaky</i> is running <span class="code">gdbserver</span> with proggy on port 12345.</p>
<p>Note that you can set a program specific gdb command
using the <i>Settings|This Program</i> menu.</p>

<h1><a name="todo"></a>To do</h1>
<p>The following is a list of things that I intend to build in some day. They
are roughly sorted most important first. You can influence the order by
<script language="JavaScript">
  document.write("<a href=\"mailt");
  document.write("o:j6");
  document.write("t@k");
  document.write("dbg.org\">");
</script>dropping me a note<script language="JavaScript">
  document.write("</a>");
</script>
or by building it in yourself and sending me the patch :-).
There is also a TODO file in the source code which lists many more items.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Display a list of files that the program is built from.</li>

<li>
Manipulating signals and how gdb handles them.</li>

<li>
Remember which structures were expanded.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following is a list of things that are not very likely ever to find
their way into KDbg.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Direct access to gdb. That is, you can't type in a gdb command and submit
it to gdb. The most direct access you get is the argument to a <span class="code">print</span>
command: through the variable watches. The idea is that every feature of
gdb is accessible by some user interface element.</li>

<li>
A graphical display like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/">DDD</a>
has.</li>
</ul>
